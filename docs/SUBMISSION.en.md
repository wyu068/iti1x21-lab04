## Identify yourself

Update the file called `STUDENT.md` with your
information.

DO NOT blindly copy and paste.

```
Student name: Linda Danvers
Student number: 123456
Course code: ITI1121
Lab: Lab04
Course section: 02
Java: 1.8
```

Provide your `name`, `student number`, course code
(`ITI1121` or `ITI1521`), lab number (e.g. `Lab02`),
two digit course section (e.g. `02`) and the version
of Java you are using (`java -version`). If you don't know
your section, please look it up.

[CodePost.io](https://codepost.io/signup/join?code=UJE6HQKYUC) currently only supports Java 1.8 out of the box,
so knowing which version will help us investigate issues if
you are using a newer version of Java.  We hope to update
to a newer version, but that might not be possible.


## Only Upload Source Code

Read the instructions for each lab about lab specific instructions.

Do not include any class files or any other generated files.

Template files have been provided, do not rename them as it will
affect the grading of these labs.

### Important remarks!

We are using automated scripts to test and grade your lab submission.
Therefore, you must follow these instructions exactly.

In particular:

* Your naming of all the files and methods must be exact.
* Use the the starter code provided during the lab to avoid problems.
* Refer to announcements in BrightSpace for any corrections
* All source files must be present and must compile
  * That is, running javac \*.java must not produce any errors even if you were unable to complete an exercise.

Note the starter code for some exercises do not compile due to
syntax errors. So even if you could not solve this exercise
completely, you have to hand in a file with the methods intact that compiles
(for example, you can put "return 0;" if you gave up).

### Submissions

Your submission is due by the Tuesday 11:00pm the week after the lab.
